Given a branch foo and a remote upstream:

As of Git 1.8.0:\\
  git branch -u upstream/foo


Or, if local branch foo is not the current branch:\\
  git branch -u upstream/foo foo


Or, if you like to type longer commands, these are equivalent to the above two:\\
  git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/foo
  git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/foo foo


As of Git 1.7.0:\\
  git branch --set-upstream foo upstream/foo
