==== How do I reset/revert a specific file to a specific revision using Git? ====
Assuming the commit you want is "abcde"
<code bash >
$ git checkout abcde file/to/restore  #恢复某个文件到指定版本
</code>

==== git 检出某个旧版本的文件? ====
  * 查看文件日志
    <code bash >
    $git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]" --graph --date=short
    </code>
   * 检出某个hash值得文件
    <code bash>
    $ git checkout 911e8c9
    Note: checking out '911e8c9'.

    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
    state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

    If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
    do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

    git checkout -b new_branch_name

    HEAD is now at 911e8c9... First Commit
