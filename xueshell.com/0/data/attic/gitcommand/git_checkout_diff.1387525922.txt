===== git 如何检出变更文件？ =====

==== 使用git diff-tree====

git diff-tree -r --no-commit-id --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRT $commit_id

    git diff-tree -r $commit_id:

    Take a diff of the given commit to its parent(s) (including all subdirectories, not just the top directory).

    --no-commit-id --name-only:

    Do not output the commit SHA1. Output only the names of the affected files instead of a full diff.

    --diff-filter=ACMRT:

    Only show files added, copied, modified, renamed or that had their type changed (eg. file → symlink) in this commit. This leaves out deleted files.
